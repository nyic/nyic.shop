**Become a member at NYIC!**

NYIC is a shop, collective, and a place for people to make physical projects come to life. We do share tools and resources and spend a lot of time observing and helping out with each othersâ€™ projects, but the shop itself is set up such that each Member has their own dedicated workbench/desk.
