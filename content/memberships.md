**Become a member at NYIC!**

While it resembles one in some ways, NYIC is not a makerspace. We do share tools and resources and spend a lot of time observing and helping out with each othersâ€™ projects, but the shop itself is set up such that each Member has their own dedicated workbench/desk. 

Shop access start at $349/mo and includes access to the 3D printers, laser and vinyl cutters, electronics workbench, shared common space, and daily use of a workbench.

Workbenches start at $695/mo and includes access to all tools, the wood shop, and storage for tools and supplies, enabling long-term projects to develop without the hassle that a makerspace imposes.
