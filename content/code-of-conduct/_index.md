# Code of Conduct

### What NYIC Is.

NYIC is a community which spans one-to-many and many-to-many digital communication, a physical workspace and the occasional in-person event. This code of conduct encompasses all of these forums, and any others that NYIC may host in the future, including:

- NYIC's workshop at Suite 332
- NYIC’s Slack instance
- Any other events which NYIC might host or help organize

### These Spaces Are For Starting Conversations

The purposes of NYIC’s social spaces are to start conversations. If you post something, it is expected that you intend to discuss it in a productive way with other members in the space - not direct them off-platform, or sell something to them, or troll them into a fight. For instance, things posted to Slack should naturally elicit productive responses within Slack - not shut them down, or direct them elsewhere, or initiate a financial transaction.

### No Harassment

NYIC is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.

Harassment means engaging in a course of comment or conduct against a person within this space that is known, or ought reasonably to be known, to be unwelcome. This includes any form of verbal or physical interactions that may cause a person to be uncomfortable. Examples may be unwanted physical or sexual attention, offensive comments, or pressure to engage in activities. Preventing harassment is everyone's responsibility. Members and guests violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled without a refund at the discretion of theprepared.org.

### Be Civil And Constructive At All Times

The topics discussed at NYIC may be contentious and/or ones that people are passionate about. Members of our community have a variety of opinions and beliefs that span the entire spectrum. As such, there are many opportunities for you as a user to be exposed to ideas and ideology that may seem foreign or difficult to accept.

It's important to mention here that we don't censor people due to their opinions, so long that they are presented in good faith. People are completely allowed to post an opinion that is not factually true, or that you believe is incorrect, or that you find unacceptable for whatever reason. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions even if you disagree with them - in these instances, remember to debate civilly and focus your efforts on explaining why you disagree. Attack the argument and not the person.

### No Personal Attacks

It doesn't matter how well written the comment is, or if your insult is sarcastic, creative or absurd: Personal or _ad hominem_ attacks are always against our rules. Name calling, demeaning, inflammatory, or other uncivil comments are not allowed - regardless of whether the person being attacked is a member of NYIC’s community.

### Proprietary Information

All discussions of proprietary information at NYIC are by default off the record. All participants in NYIC’s various communication channels agree to abide by [the FriendDA](https://friendda.org/?ref=scopeofwork.net) unless an alternate arrangement is explicitly and formally agreed to. If you overhear something that tickles your interest and might be construed to be private, you should contact the speaker directly and get explicit confirmation from them before adapting, disseminating, or promoting it on their behalf.

### Self Promotion

NYIC allows self promotional conversation; we encourage you to talk about and be proud of the things that you’re working on. You could say that theprepared.org was in fact built on the idea that individual practitioners should do a better job of documenting their work and sharing their perspectives on the worlds they inhabit.

It is, of course, important to remember the context in which you share content that you have a vested interest in. Share things that you’re proud of, but above all be sure to make space for things that are _interesting._ In general, you should disclose any relationship with things you have a stake in.

### What To Do If You Believe This Code Of Conduct Has Been Violated

If you directly witness a violation of this Code of Conduct, please [contact us by email](mailto:info@nyic.shop).
