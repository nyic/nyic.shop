If you're working on physical projects in NYC, you know how hard it is to find an affordable, convenient workshop. NYIC is organized to be flexible, offering just the right amenities for you to build your business and sustain hobby time in a friendly, supportive environment.

While it resembles one in some ways, NYIC is not a makerspace. We do share tools and resources and spend a lot of time observing and helping out with each others' projects, but the shop itself is set up such that each Member has their own dedicated workbench/desk.

NYIC also hosts a range of in-person events, including the NY Hardware Meetup, talks & tours by The New York Infrastructure Observatory, and periodic shop hangs.
